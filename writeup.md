## Question 1


What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?


The most common sentiment observed in my sample is "negative".


## Question 2


How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?


There's always a risk of misinterpreting data and mislabeling review. Positive or negative review could be labeled as neutral, and vice versa. I ran into a serious issue, and unfortunately wasn't able to resolve it: the AI split several reviews at commas, bringing a final count to a variety between 58 to 65 any time I ran the code. Although, negative reviews are prevalent every time, which makes me confident that this is the case for this product.


## Question 3


Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?


I would recommend ZICO to improve the taste of the water based on the reviews that we got, and host another sampling event in a few months to test it again.
